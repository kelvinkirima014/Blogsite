Hi! Welcome to my website where I occasionally blog about the Rust programming language.

This site’s source code is available on GitHub.


About Me

I am a hobbyist Rust programmer, mainly spending my time contributing to open source projects. I’ve been using the language since October 2019, before which I mostly used C and C++. I am also decent at JavaScript and TypeScript, mostly in browser contexts.

You can find me via:

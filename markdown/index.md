## Brief 
Hi! Welcome to my website where I occasionally blog about the Rust programming language.

This site’s source code is available on GitHub.


## About Me

I am a Rust programmer, mainly spending my time building Rust web apps and backend tools. I’ve been using the language since September 2021, before which I mostly programmed in JavaScript and NodeJS. I am also decent with TypeScript.

## Brief

Hello! Welcome to my website where I occasionally blog about Programming, the Web, and the Rust programming language. This site's source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/kelvinkirima014/kelvinkirima.com).

## About Me 

I am a computer programmer, mainly spending my time building Rust web apps and backend tools. Iâ€™ve been using the language since September 2021, before which I mostly programmed in JavaScript and NodeJS. I am also decent with TypeScript.

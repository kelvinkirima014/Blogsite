HelloüëãüèΩ! Welcome to my website where I occasionally blog about Programming, the Web, and the Rust programming language. This site's source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/kelvinkirima014/kelvinkirima.com).

## About Me 

I am a computer programmer, mainly spending my time building web apps and backend tools in Rust and Node.js. I‚Äôve been using Rust since September 2021, before which I mostly programmed in JavaScript; I am decent with TypeScript as well. Besides programming, I also enjoy taking long nature walks and reading/writing about things I find interesting. This blog will mainly be a collection of such writings.
